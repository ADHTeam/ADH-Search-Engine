## Introduction

This document presents the overview, organization, and managerial and technical process associated to our search engine.
Final product of our project is going to be a simple, yet powerful and fast, (web) search engine. We call the resulting
system ADH Search Engine. Roughly speaking, the system crawls web pages (as many as possible) and indexes keywords found
in them. It later consults the index to answer queries. Furthermore, it uses a variant of Googleâ€™s PageRank Algorithm to
rank its output, so that pages with higher rank will appear first in the search output.
