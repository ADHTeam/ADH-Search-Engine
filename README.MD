## Introduction

This document presents the overview, organization, and managerial and technical process associated to our search engine.
Final product of our project is going to be a simple, yet powerful and fast, (web) search engine. We call the resulting
system ADH Search Engine. Roughly speaking, the system crawls web pages (as many as possible) and indexes keywords found
in them. It later consults the index to answer queries. Furthermore, it uses a variant of Googleâ€™s PageRank Algorithm to
rank its output, so that pages with higher rank will appear first in the search output.

## Organization
In this section, we are going elaborate on process model and team organization.

### Process Model
We are going to adapt Waterfall process model. Therefore, we are going through Communication (to gather and analyze user
requirements), Planning (to plan and identify risks), Modeling (to do architectural and detailed design), Construction (to
implement and test), Deployment (to deploy the final product) phases.

### Team Organization
The team ADH  comprises of three members: Ali Ghanbari, Dongcheng Li, and Haoliang Wang. Management in our team is going to pass
from one member to another in a periodic manner. The role of manager will be to monitor activities of the team, and will decide if
the team is progressing as it is supposed to. Besides transient responsibilities (such as management) we have fixed responsibilities
as well. For example, Ali will always be responsible for revising final deliverables, Haoliang is going to be the fixed maintainer of
the team website (also its database and all other on-line issues regarding the team website), and Dongcheng will be assigned to the fixed
responsibility of conducting thorough tests on the final implementation. Finally, we need to mention that all the team members will be
equally involved in design and implementation activities.

## Technical Perspective
In this section we are going to present technical presents related to the project. These include the tools, programming frameworks, and programming languages that we are going to use.

### Tools & Frameworks
The following table lists the tools that we are going to use in our project.
